Uses Gatsby.

1. Install dependencies (`yarn install`):

2. Develop locally (`yarn develop`)

3. Publish:

`vercel deploy` 

(alias vercel to `now` for nostalgia and joy)

## TODO

Content

- get a single post out the door
- bring home the posts from substack
- bring to substack things that I want there
- cull things I don't want out in the world

Features and design

- update look and feel so I am happier about them, and will want to publish more
    - size of things
    - about
    - best posts
    - playground
- get rid of 'old posts' hiding, just remove bad / old things
- consider features that will change my authoring experience (see Michael
    Nielsen's post about how to use a personal site for thinking)
- Consider page types I'd like to include:
  - working notes seems like a real win
  - playgrounds seem so cool
- solicit more interaction
    - "If you've read and enjoyed this post, I would love it it you reached
        out!" I need you to trust that I can manage my own inbox, and that I
        really do want you to cold email (or twitter DM) me!
