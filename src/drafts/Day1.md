## Memorable:
So much, so fast!

Sam impressed upon me the importance of openness and trust, and set the expectation that they were related, and they were earned - on both sides. (Speaking re: employee relationships.)
Speed and Quality are tricky to balance, especially as we scale.
What was surprising? (No good answer in the moment. Now: How informal processes are, so far)
Agents and Developers are in the same room, but the roles are pretty distinct; agenting all day is different from agenting once in a while and engineering most of every day.
Learning a ton about development, really fast - code is in relatively decent shape, with semi-solid tests for lots of things
Still feeling out of my depth, sometimes some of the discussions and conversations go over my head, but others feel like they make sense

Not sure what I pictured in my head, but this is pretty wild and different!

Not a lot of time for other things, not when this is happening all day every weekday (and we'll see about weekends...)
It's fun learning, but it's also tough mentally with all the new concepts, and emotionally, with the stress and overwhelmed feelings, plus not having tons of time to recuperate and talk with friends
