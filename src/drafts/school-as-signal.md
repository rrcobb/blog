Other things school should do for you

# Brand Name School as Signal

Where you attend high school and college serves as a potent status signal.

This is not surprising or new. Much of this post might be obvious to you if you've spent much time around US colleges and universities or recruiting.

Still, it matters that teachers recognize it and inform students, so that they can plan around it. If you are 

And, as a reason for wanting a student to go to the best school possible:
"I want you to have all doors open to you / maximum available choices"

Recruiters know it - they look for the alma mater as a valuable signal on a resume.

Recruiters work:
1. generate recruiting leads
2. get applications from leads
3. validate applicants
4. get to 'yes' with validated applicants

Recruiters are motivated to minimize work and maximize output (number of accepted applicants), while meeting some basic specs:
look busy - minimum number of applicants at different stages of the pipeline
low percentage of false positives - applicants validated as quality candidates who turn out to be bad

School name or brand signals that an applicant has already passed an important filter - getting into and graduating from Princevale!
- justifiable
- less work to discern good candidates from bad
- higher fraction of good candidates

If the top ranks of the top organizations are already filled by folks from the 'best' schools,
- more likely that there's an alumni connection a recruiter can make to increase the likelihood that an offer will be accepted


# School as a place to connect
Related, but different from school as status signal
Connections to other people of that social status/ intelligence / access to those memes

It's common enough to hear in conversation about college (particularly when parents of high schoolers are talking about college applications)
"It's all about the people you meet/connections you make"

Let's delve a little deeper into this common wisdom. What could people mean by this?
(obviously, most people are just regurgitating cached wisdom, but let's be [_generous_](rapoports-rules))

As advice to students (from least to most cynical, maybe)
- focus on friendships and connections, as they will determine your happiness in school
- focus on friendships and connections, as those friendships will be a dominant factor in your long-term happiness
- focus on friendships and connections, as those connections will be a dominant factor in your long-term success
- focus on friendships and connections, as they will determine your status in the social heirarchy in school
- focus on friendships and connections, as those heirarchy-climbing social-circle-navigating skills are valuable in the long term

As a communication about the reality of school:
- who you hang out with will impact the way you study and what you do and talk about between classes
- who you hang out with will impact the way you spend your time
- who you hang out with will impact the way you feel about your studies
- who you hang out with will impact the way you feel about the way you spend your time

### Short Term:
Easier time forming friendships with tailored group
Hand-picked for combination of diversity + intelligence (in theory)
Real effact on learning environment - better peers mean better learning
Learn how to pass / signal status / use elite shibboleths

### Long term:
Access/connection to individuals with 
- power
- money
- intelligence
- status
