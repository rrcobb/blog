# Institutional Trust as a Centrist Agenda

Trust in government is good. Obviously, blind trust or trust earned with lies, propaganda, or favoritism is bad.

## Some instances of lack of trust:
- lack of trust in police
- lack of trust in fairness of welfare programs
- lack of trust in regulators to
   - regulate bad players effectively
   - not regulate unduly
- lack of trust in

## Why is trust good?
1. Enables cooperation in prisoner's dilemma & related games.

Tragedy of the commons is solved by verifiable trust that everyone will cooperate. Many bad situations are shaped this way.

2. Shared, agreeable framing of polarizing issues
Individuals ought to trust that if they try hard & play fair, they can get ahead - hence welfare
Welfare system is redistributionist, complex, and opaque - hence mistrust of welfare

We can all agree that we want a system where everyone can trust that they'll be treated fairly by their government. Then, we want to seek out the areas of mistrust and figure out ways to solve them (with a strong prejudice against things that seem dystopic, like building propaganda machines without checks and balances).


## Examples of organizations and practices that foster trust?
ACLU
FOIA
Census
BLS
Open Data
Good, clear, deep reporting
Clear rules for what constitutes conflict of interest,
Clear rules for disclosure

## Examples of organizations and systems that erode trust?
Secrets - National Defense & Homeland Security (inherently tricky!)
SEC
IRS
Contracting
Revolving Doors
Citizens United

## What are the gaping holes in this framing?
Some debates fall pretty squarely outside of it - immigration?
Framing does not resolve genuine differences in values - some value trust in safety net, some value trust that they aren't getting cheated.
Impossible not to get some of these examples wrong / miss some examples
Worth talking to actual people on the ground, seeing if lack of trust in institutions jives with their sentiment
Other explanations that this might crowd out? Apathy, difficulty of governance, stupidity, malice

## Ways this view is tempting because I can bash the outgroup with it?
Can bash Trump for kleptocracy / focusing campaign messaging on highlighting reasons to mistrust institutions
Can bash the radical left for excitement to tear down institutions
Can bash Hillary for being a key figure of mistrust, obliquely damaging trust in institutions
Can bash the libertarians for ideologically mistrusting institutions (maybe?)
Can bash the left dems for missing this entirely & building systems that are difficult to trust, failing in the fight against the meme of the welfare queen
Can bash Senate + Congress for trashing norms of institutions (Supreme Court, filibuster, budget process, debt ceiling, Obamacare)
Can bash Obama for executive actions (getting a little weak, how else can this be used to bash Obama?)
Can bash Hillary and co. + Trump and co. + esp. Jill Stein for eroding faith in election system
Can bash Mainstream Media for failure to ever be any good at anything at all
Can bash actual institutions for not being trustworthy enough
Can bash white people/patriarchy for history of abuses, not doing enough to build institutions that everyone can trust

If no one is immune to bashing, is it really a likely framing for anyone to pick up and use?
How do we rachet this kind of meme forward in general, when benefits are distributed and there is no party that can immediately gain from it?
- reframing might be good for any side at a particular moment (good for left now, to attack trump with)
- maybe there are remaining good-government centrists?
- maybe the theory fits with people's view of the world, so they spread it?

## This theory, applied to some specific tricky problems

### Elections
### Tax Code
### Research Funding
### EPA
### FDA
