I'm Rob.

I graduated in December 2014 from UMD with a degreee in _Entrepreneurship and Innovation in STEM Education_. Iâ€™m working on making education better. That means

- more access
- more value
- more relevant
- more interesting

I teach web development at [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/campuses/washington-dc/), a software developer bootcamp.

I live in Washington, DC.

Some Things I've worked on:

- [umd.io](https://umd.io/)
