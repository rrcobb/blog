I'm Rob.

I've bounced back and forth between software and education. I care a lot about 
making education better, especially for people learning to program computers.

To me, better education means

- more access
- more value
- more relevant

The best thing about writing online is getting to talk with people. I really love
those conversations, so if you read anything here and want to talk, please cold 
email or dm me on twitter.

I used to have a substack newsletter, [CS Education](https://csed.substack.com/).

My cofounders and I tried starting [Kibo](https://www.kibo.school/), a new university online for young learners in Africa. We couldn't figure out student financing, so we shut it down in 2024. [More reflections here](https://substack.com/home/post/p-150101879).
