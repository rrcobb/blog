I'm Rob.

I've bounced back and forth between software and education. I care a lot about 
making education better, especially for people learning to program computers.

To me, better education means

- more access
- more value
- more relevant

The best thing about writing online is getting to talk with people. I really love
those conversations, so if you read anything here and want to talk, please cold 
email or dm me on twitter.

I sometimes post updates on my substack newsletter, [CS Education](https://csed.substack.com/).

I live in Washington, DC.

Lately, I've been working on [Kibo](https://www.kibo.school/), a new online
university for African students. We're building a CS degree first.

Some things I've worked on in the past:

- [Make School](https://makeschool.org/)
- [SchoolHouse](https://www.getschoolhouse.com/)
- [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/)
- [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com)
- [Fin](https://www.fin.com/)
- [umd.io](https://umd.io/)
- [TIC Summer Camp](http://ticcamp.com/)
- [UMD Help Center](https://helpcenterumd.org/)

More at my [github](https://github.com/rrcobb). Also I have a code [playground](//playground.rob.co.bb) with some experiments.
