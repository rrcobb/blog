I'm Rob.

I work at [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com) helping people learn and change their own lives.

Working in CS Education means I get to talk with smart people about what better education looks like.

To me, better education means

- more access
- more value
- more relevant

I live in Washington, DC.

Some things I've worked on:

- [Fin](https://www.fin.com/)
- [umd.io](https://umd.io/)
- [TIC Summer Camp](http://ticcamp.com/)
- [UMD Help Center](https://helpcenterumd.org/)

More at my [github](https://github.com/rrcobb). Also I have a code [playground](//playground.rob.co.bb) with some experiments.
