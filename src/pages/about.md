I'm Rob.

I'm working on building community for code teachers across bootcamps, K-12, higher ed, and online.

Sign up for news and updates on [CS Education](https://csed.substack.com/)

Working in CS Education means I get to talk with smart people about what better education looks like.

To me, better education means

- more access
- more value
- more relevant

I live in Washington, DC.

Some things I've worked on:

- [umd.io](https://umd.io/)
- [TIC Summer Camp](http://ticcamp.com/)
