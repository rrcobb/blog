Here are some blogs and websites I read. 

I like a lot of blogs in the vague space of rationalism / progress studies / 
public intellectual economists. I also enjoy a lot of programmer writing, mostly 
ones that are friendly and explain things. Sometimes there's overlap, sometimes
not.

- If you like something here, let's chat about it!
- If you find something else online you think I'd like, send it to me!
- If you want to chat and get personalized recommended reading, I'm actually 
    pretty good about sending links after chatting.

Again, I'm putting this website here online so that people find it and talk to me.

## Notes

One thing that's really cool is that a lot of these authors refer and link to
each other. There's a real web of community, connection, and interlinked
thought.
