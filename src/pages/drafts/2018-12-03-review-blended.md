## Overview<a id="sec-1-1"></a>

This book comes from Michael Horner and Heather Staker of the Clayton Christensen Institute. Christensen is renown for popularizing the term 'Disruptive Innovation' in popular discourse through his book _The Innovator's Dilemma_. (That's who you can blame for _that_ term). The book more or less is an application of the basic ideas from the _Innovator's Dilemma_ to education. As such, the book comes across as _very_ Harvard Business School. It's heavy on reasoning by analogy and anecdote, strong on case study, short on randomized controlled trials, and missing mechanistic theories for the effects of their proposed interventions. So, the tone didn't quite fit my sensibilities. What can one do?

That said, the book does capture and categorize a _ton_ of practices that teachers are actually using in classrooms. It prompted lots of thought as I read it too - in particular, about how we ought to apply some of the principles and learnings to our teaching at Flatiron School, where I teach. Even with all the frustrating jargon, _Blended_ actually makes a compelling case. 

1) We should be using technology to make education better
2) Technology alone won't make things better
3) We won't get rid of classes and teachers
4) Education should put student needs at the center of our solutions
5) There are lots of pertinent details about any particular situation that inform the way we should use technology

I was more impressed by the second half of the book than the first. The authors moved from abstract descriptions and prognostication to practical cases and fairly down-to-earth recommendations for particular audiences. If I had only read the first few chapters (or if I had read coverage of the book instead of the actual book), I might have assumed that the authors were blind to the widespread misapplication of technology in classrooms. Instead, the authors appreciate that adding tech to classrooms without a strategy often harms outcomes (and is expensive besides!)

This 'review' is mostly a cleaned-up brain dump of my notes as I was reading. They have been significantly, but not entirely, de-snarked.

## TLDR;<a id="sec-1-2"></a>

This book is a good summary of trends in Blended Education. It doesn't introduce a ton of new ideas. It collects and links lots of ideas nicely. It probably would have been better as a couple of blog posts instead of a book. There was a lot of fluff to get through.

## Chapter 1: What Is Blended Learning?<a id="sec-1-3-1"></a>

Definitions and categories in this chapter. I found it vaguely frustrating. The names for the clusters mostly made sense, but there wasn't a ton of great justification for _why_ the authors chose to categorize the way they did. Since there was a whole section on mixing the models, I am mostly convinced that the boundaries between these models are _super_ blurry and we shouldn't put too much trust in the notion that any program fits neatly into one or another.

> Generally speaking, if it does not fit squarely within the Rotation, Flex, A La Carte, or Enriched Virtual definition, a blended-learning program is likely a combination of those models.
>
> Page 52 · Location 1719

Why have we given these patterns names? Are they differentially effective? Is this just clusters of observed phenomena? Is there any sense of how accurate the clusters are? No, because this isn't a science book. I am grumpy.

> latter, the learning activities are standardized across the class.
> Page 53 · Location 1729

How well do these clusters map to reality? I.e. is there really no pacing in a rotation or flex model or other blended model? Do students in a tech-rich classroom really not have control over pace, place, path?

I would love to see data about classrooms graphed on a graph. Cluster analysis is real, folks.

### Defining Blended Learning

I had some issues with the way they drew the line for blended learning. To me, using an LMS where the student can acccess the material outside the classroom seems just as _blended_ as using a Station Rotation.

Some quotes and reactions:

(re: using an online LMS that students can use to access course materials outside the classroom)

> but it is not managing the delivery of content and instruction;
>
> (Page 36 · Location 1413)

Doesn't it though? Isn't that what a 'Learning Management System' is built to do?

> Dominique does not have control over the time, place, path, or pace of her learning.
> 
> Page 36 · Location 1414

Doesn't she though? Isn't that implied by the existence of the online resource?

> each student the right level of content at each moment of instruction.
> 
> Page 36 · Location 1416

Each student at each moment seems like a high bar -- one that none of these models is likely to achieve.

> despite that fact that the online courses themselves do not have a face-to-face component.
> 
> Page 49 · Location 1652

Seems like a wacky way to draw your boundary. 


### Four Models

### Questions

1. Retesting and mastery

> reset assignments and quizzes to test for mastery afterward.
>
> Page 51 · Location 1696

Question: Does retesting work for mastery? 👀

2. Teacher of record

> teachers of record
>
> Page 51 · Location 1700

Question: What does 'Teacher of Record' mean? The concept of a ‘teacher of record’ is not defined or explored. This is surprising, given how often it’s used. Does it just mean something for accreditation? Does it mean something specific for evaluation? Expertise? On the google box, I get some crappy Yahoo Answers, plus a decent (though oblique) [article from edweek](http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/finding_common_ground/2013/04/why_do_we_need_teacher_of_record.html), which cites a Michigan definition:

> The teacher of record is the certificated teacher who provides instruction, who tests and quizzes, who evaluates the pupil's performance and gives the pupil a grade.

I guess it's a state law thing? For holding teachers accountable for the students they teach?

At flatiron, some lesson content (readmes, videos) are online, and we have the do-supported-homework part down. Q: do we want to move more lecture to video? Basically “flipping” for us likely looks the same as “reducing lecture, and possibly replacing it with videos”

All together, the data seems gerrymandered. Which models are and aren't 'blended' doesn't seem to be based on a thoroughly consistent set of rules. I could have done without this chapter, or with a replacement that was something along the lines of

"Blended learning is when we mix components of traditional classrooms and new online education. There are lots of different ways to do this. We've noticed four common patterns, which we call Rotation, Flex, A La Carte, and Enriched Virtual. (description of each)."

Student Centered Learning: 
- competency / mastery based
- personalized

Personalized
- blooms two sigmas
- is tutoring that expensive?
- “Prohibitively”?
- what about tutoring works? Guesses:
   - feedback quickly
   - not wasting time or focus
   - can fill in gaps reactively
   - doesn’t miss with examples (mostly)

Mastery / Competency
- don’t allow gaps in knowledge
- reduces spread between advanced and behind students
- no concept left behind
- does this imply cutting a ton of curriculum in order to bring more time and focus to the things that are more critical, and establishing mastery over them?

Blended
- student agency and empowerment
- helps do student centered learning at scale
- their keys:
  - students control pace / place
  - teachers shift roles
  - from content delivery to
  - “learning designers, mentors, facilitators, tutors, evaluators, and counselors”
- “online” is not blended

“Online” as a stand in for 'using computers'

Asks from local schools:
- differentiation (to reach high and low achievers)
- access to broader range of offerings
- costs 

School of One
- math summer school
- testing at the end of each day
- custom ‘playlist’ for each student each day
- 7x faster growth than comparable group
- “it awakens in students an awareness of their strengths and weaknesses, which inspires them to conquer their daily online assessments and move on to master new skills.”
- scaling is hard...

ACCESS (alabama distance learning)
- 3x enrollment in AP courses
- 2x college credit
- 10x african american enrollment

KIPP Empowerment (LA)
- kindergarten budget slashed
- computer powered “station rotation”
- more effective use of instructional staff
- “In total, the financial benefit equated to roughly $ 1,467 per pupil. 45 Supporting a blended model did entail some extra hardware, software, and personnel costs that total approximately $ 502 per pupil—roughly $ 965 less than the financial benefit.”
- do we know how our costs break down per student?


“Antiquated” as a negative :/
- what in particular is bad?
- old things aren’t always bad!


Broadly, the book tends to be _uncareful_ in a way that irks me. For instance, the citation for 

> forecasted that by 2019, 50 percent of high school courses would be online in some form or fashion. Years later that prediction continues to appear accurate—some would even say conservative. 2 People may debate the timing, but we believe the more interesting question is whether the indisputable emergence of online learning across elementary, middle, and high schools is a good thing.

Is 

> 2 Tom Vander Ark, the author of Getting Smart, stated at a Hoover Institution conference that the Disrupting Class prediction that 50 percent of high school classes would be online or blended before the end of the decade seemed crazy five years ago, but that he believes the prediction will be achieved before the stated date. See Tom Vander Ark, “Blended Learning in K–12 Education,” Hoover Institution, Stanford University, January 17, 2014, Policy Panel.

This is persuedoscience. The looseness and lack of rigor make me trust the authors less, even if I agree with the main thrust of what they are saying.


Competency info seems super important as a checklist (from https://www.inacol.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/iNACOL_Its_Not_A_Matter_of_Time_full_report.pdf):

1. Students advance upon demonstrated mastery. 
2. Competencies include explicit, measurable, transferable learning objectives that empower students.
3. Assessment is meaningful and a positive learning experience for students. 
4. Students receive rapid, differentiated support based on their individual learning needs. 
5. Learning outcomes emphasize competencies that include application and creation of knowledge along with the development of important skills and dispositions. 

Built into many notions of competency-based learning is a sense of “minimum pace” or “teacher pace,” which means that students can't just flail along, learn nothing, and remain stuck. More and more attention should be given to students who are lagging, so that they continue to progress at a minimum pace and not fall further behind.


Mastery-based education seems awesome and like it ought to be the only thing. If its not mastery, then what the eff is it? 

> Narrator: just talking at students and busywork. Thats what it is.

If we are going to look at the economics of schools, should we build actual economic models of education? See how spending tracks with growth in spending in other industries? We might find that education as a sector experiences less (or lagging) productivity gains, and is subject to Baumol’s cost disease in a way that explains increased expenditures without needing more explanation

Is the confusion with “edtech” inevitable? Why are we so smart and yet so bad at recognizing that words have shifting fuzzy definitions?

Blended checklist:
- (some) online learning
- student control
   - pace
   - place
   - time
   - path (or even content!)
- (some) out of home brick n mortar
- guidance of instructor
- online + in person are coordinated

Is there a better term than “brick and mortar”? Concrete and steel are now larger in our construction materials, I bet

When we are evaluating the effectiveness of models, stats are important, but don’t really speak to the causal mechanism. Bloom’s 2 Sigma seems like a prime example of hazy understanding of guesses at a mechanism, but no rigor. Is it just that having someone older nearby radiates an aura of understanding that you absorb through the skin? Stats don’t speak to this at least not the ones presented in Blended)

More poignant for “READ 180” which doesn’t quite meet the statistical power for its low gain in student improvement, according to the “what works clearinghouse” which itself seems like an important institution / resource

Note: we are operating mostly blind / by feel as to what things work and what things don’t as teachers
Mostly guided by intuition
And what little we remember from studies we’ve read

Should we be conducting studies with controls and statistical power? Should we be engaging in research here at Flatiron?

How much leverage is in just choosing content that matters _at all_? Seems like a big portion of education “effectiveness” might secretly be that we are choosing what to teach poorly (or not aligned with what we measure)

It could be that the highest leverage thing to do at flatiron is to remove parts from the curriculum!

Our job as a school _is not_ to provide information. It is to filter information to only that what is relevant.

How much is just that students spend more time learning and less time transitioning / wasting time?


## Chapter 5: Motivate the Students

After welcoming the students back to school, Mr. Allen held up a pitcher full to the brim with water and explained that the water represented all of the amazing knowledge in that classroom for the children to soak up during the year ahead. Everything the children might ever want to explore was stuffed inside that water. Then he held up a clear bowl. “This is your brain,” he explained. “See how it's empty and cup shaped? It's perfect for holding that knowledge. But some students come to school like this.” He turned the bowl upside down and poured water from the pitcher onto the underside of the bowl, so the water ran down the sides and splattered to the ground. The children squealed, amazed that the teacher had poured so much water right onto the rug. “Some students choose not to try to learn, and it's sad for them, because look at that waste of knowledge.” Next Mr. Allen pulled the bowl away from the pitcher and dumped several cups of water directly onto the rug. “Other students decide not to come to school at all,” he said. “They don't get enough sleep, their families don't really care about school, and they're often late to class. How sad for them. Look at all that waste of knowledge.” Finally, the teacher turned the bowl right side up and said, “I can see that this room is full of students with brains like this.” He poured the remaining water into the bowl until it was completely full. “I can see that you are going to fill your brains with all of the adventures that await you in this classroom. Be like this bowl, ready to learn.”

School administrators can support bottom-up approaches from teachers by encouraging and facilitating their efforts to innovate. Helping teachers have time to plan and learn, providing professional development opportunities for them, and clearing obstacles that are in their way, such as technological barriers, is vital. By the same token, school leaders can be proactive in forming teams and inviting teachers to join those teams to respond to a variety of rallying cries.
