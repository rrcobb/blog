This past Friday was my last day at Flatiron School. I worked
there for just shy of two years, since starting as the first Software
Engineering instructor in DC in February of 2018. I am going to miss it.

Saying bye to people on the last day, leaving notes
 - really nice to be reminded of the amazing people I got to work with
 - felt loved by them

Things I loved (and still love) about Flatiron School
- teammates
- students
- mission
- impactful work
- learning and growth

Why leave?
- flatiron’s really great - why leave?
- the challenges are now in executing and managing at scale
- My long term goals, vaguely, are focused on unlocking human potential and moving the world towards a vision of individual flourishing
- my comparative advantage (and interest) lies in innovating in teaching people to code, and I’d like to explore that on my own

What’s next for me?
- connecting code teachers across contexts
- helping early coders navigate the confusing and intimidating learn-to-code landscape
- more structured pathways into coding for people of particular backgrounds
- writing about the CS learning landscape overview
- explicit modeling of learning / career journeys (and more explicit modeling
  in general!)
- CS pedagogy corner - ways we ought to teach, from other things we know about
  how people learn + what is special about teaching CS
- finding rough patches in the learning journey and smoothing them

Learning 
- more computing fundamentals
- more teaching and learning fundamentals
- always more fundamentals to learn!

How does it feel?
- Nervous! No longer the security of a paycheck coming in
- Many other aspects of work that have been part of my life - structure,
  accountability, work socializing, people to lean on and learn from, shared
  vision and goals, etc. I'll have to replace those!
- Exciting too - special feeling of ownership, sense that I can make it
- Sad to be leaving a team that I care so much about
- But, despite that, good that the team and the school are in good hands and on
  a healthy trajectory

The dirty details, for those who are thinking about quitting their job:
- I have leads on some freelance and consulting opportunities, that I hope will
  pan out
- I have savings that ought to cover me for a year+ without missing rent
- I'm lucky to be in a career where there are jobs, in case freelance /
  consulting / building my own business don't work out
- I've set a hard rule for myself that I'm not allowed to look for or apply to a
  job for 6 months, so I am not halfway in, halfway out.

Call to action: I have lots of unstructured time now, so if you want to catch
up, let's chat! I'm explicitly working on building community among people who
teach coding, so if you have thoughts or opinions about how people learn CS,
software engineering, or coding, please reach out!
